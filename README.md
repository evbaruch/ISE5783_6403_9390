## Introduction

The mini-project serves as a practical application of the principles and methods learned in the Introduction to Software Engineering course. Its purpose is to demonstrate the relevance of software engineering in real-world scenarios and to provide us, as students, with hands-on experience in the field.

The specific problem statement for this project is to develop a renderer that can generate high-quality images efficiently, while adhering to software engineering best practices. Rendering involves creating visual representations of objects or scenes based on input data. In this project, we focused on implementing rendering techniques, particularly ray tracing, to achieve realistic and visually appealing results.

The requirements for the renderer include producing images of good quality within optimal time frames, following best practices in software engineering, and avoiding any code smells. The aim is to develop a renderer that is efficient, maintainable, and scalable. This project enables us to apply software engineering methodologies to address these requirements, including requirements analysis, system design, implementation, testing, and maintenance.

By working on this mini-project, we not only gain a deeper understanding of software engineering principles but also acquire knowledge and practical skills in rendering and ray tracing. It allows us to explore the intersection between software engineering and graphics, bridging the gap between theory and real-world application. Additionally, the project reinforces the importance of optimal software design, even though quantitative criteria for optimality in software design may be subjective and based on judgment and experience.

Through this mini-project, we aim to develop a functional renderer that not only meets the specified requirements but also demonstrates our proficiency in software engineering methodologies. The knowledge and experience gained from this project will serve as a solid foundation for our future endeavors in the field of software engineering.

## Project Scope and Objectives

The scope of the project encompasses the development of a renderer that includes geometries, lighting, and primitives. The specific objectives of the project are as follows:

- Implement Geometries: Develop the necessary data structures and algorithms to represent and manipulate geometric models, such as polygons, spheres, or cubes.
- Lighting Implementation: Incorporate lighting effects into the renderer, including ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting, to enhance the visual quality of the rendered images.
- Primitives: Implement primitives such as points, rays, and vectors to support geometric calculations and transformations within the renderer.
- Unit Tests: Create comprehensive unit tests for each component of the renderer, including geometries, lighting, and primitives, to ensure their correctness and reliability.
- Testing: Conduct thorough testing of the renderer's functionalities, including unit tests, integration tests, and specific tests for features such as reflection, refraction, rendering improvements, shadows, and camera functionality.

The project will focus on the mentioned objectives and the specific components listed above. However, certain elements are excluded from the scope:

- User Interface (UI): The project will not include a graphical user interface or interactive controls for the renderer. The emphasis is on the core rendering functionalities and their implementation.
- Advanced Rendering Techniques: While the project involves rendering techniques such as reflection and refraction, more advanced techniques like global illumination or path tracing are beyond the scope of this mini-project.

By defining the scope and objectives, we can manage expectations and ensure that the project remains focused on its primary goals. The inclusion and exclusion of certain components help allocate resources and time effectively, enabling us to deliver a functional renderer that meets the specified requirements within the given timeframe.

## Methodology

For the mini-project, we adopted a software development methodology based on best practices from software engineering, with a focus on Object-Oriented Design (OOD) and iterative development.

**Object-Oriented Design (OOD):** We incorporated principles of OOD into our methodology, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. OOD promotes modular, readable, and maintainable code by organizing software components into reusable and interconnected modules. By leveraging OOD, we aimed to create a flexible and extensible renderer with clear separation of concerns.

**Responsibility-Driven Design (RDD):** We followed the RDD approach, which focuses on identifying and assigning responsibilities to classes and objects based on their roles and behaviors within the system. This approach helped us create a well-structured design that encapsulates the necessary functionalities and promotes modularity.

**Design Patterns:** Throughout the project, we utilized several design patterns to solve common design problems and improve the overall structure of our code. These included the Iterator pattern, Template Method pattern, Composite pattern, Builder pattern, and Wrapper pattern. Each pattern provided specific benefits in terms of code organization, reusability, and flexibility.

**Ray Tracing and Rendering Techniques:** We focused on implementing ray tracing techniques within the renderer. Ray casting and ray tracing algorithms formed the foundation of our rendering process, enabling the generation of realistic images by simulating the behavior of light rays. We also incorporated the Phong Reflectance Model to enhance the visual quality of the rendered images, taking into account ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting components.

**Avoidance of Anti-patterns:** Throughout the development process, we aimed to identify and avoid common anti-patterns, such as needless complexity and unnecessary repetition. By applying code refactoring techniques, we continuously improved the clarity and maintainability of our codebase.

**Continual Improvement:** We explored various methods to improve ray tracing, such as implementing jittered sampling techniques to reduce artifacts and improve the overall quality of the rendered images. By incorporating these improvements, we strived to create a more visually appealing and realistic rendering output.

By following these methodologies and practices, we were able to effectively manage the project, balance requirements and constraints, and continuously improve the quality of our software solution. The iterative nature of our approach allowed us to incrementally develop and refine the renderer, ensuring that it met the specified requirements while adhering to best practices in software engineering.
